# checkers_qulture_challenge

Description

Checkers game developed in Ruby for a selective process of a company. 
I have used "ruby2d" for the GUI and installed it following the instructions below:
http://www.ruby2d.com/learn/windows/
Execute the game through "mingw64.exe" console, opening the main file ("main.rb", inside the "lib" folder) with Ruby.

Grid of this game was based on this game's grid: https://github.com/acouprie/linky

The game

When the user clicks on the text "Play" the game begins. It can be played with 2 players, using the same mouse. The player 1 always starts and has the white stones. The player 2 has the black ones.
The rules of the game are the same of from this game https://www.jogos360.com.br/master_checkers.html
When a stone becames pink, it means that it has a mandatory jump for it.
The first player to loose all his stones, looses the game and it ends, showing on the screen who won. To play it again, the user has to close it and open again.
